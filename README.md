# 📦 Wewantwaste Skip Size Page Redesign

This project is a redesign of the "Choose Your Skip Size" page on the WeWantWaste website. The goal was to give the page a completely different look while keeping all existing functionality.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **React** (JavaScript)
- **Tailwind CSS** – for rapid, responsive, and maintainable styling
- **Fetch API** – for retrieving skip data from the API

## 🎯 Design Approach

- Since the task did not specify any styling framework, I chose **Tailwind CSS** as it's both efficient and well-suited for responsive UI development.
- I used the **brand color** (`#ff8a00`) from the official website to ensure consistency with the company’s identity.
- I implemented both **dark mode** and **light mode** to enhance accessibility and user experience.
- Skip options are dynamically fetched from api.
- Product images were sourced from the official website. A few missing ones with similar alternatives found online.

## 🖥️ Features

- Fully responsive layout (mobile & desktop)
- Clean and accessible UI
- Data fetched from live API
- Light/Dark mode toggle
- Brand-consistent color scheme
